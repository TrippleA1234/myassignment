            INTRODUCTION TO JAVASCRRIPT
        </b>
    </p>
    <p class="container-fluid">
        Around 10 years ago, Jeff Atwood (the founder of stackoverflow) made a case that JavaScript is going to be the
        future and he coined the “Atwood Law” which states that Any application that can be written in JavaScript will
        eventually be written in JavaScript. Fast-forward to today, 10 years later, if you look at it rings truer than
        ever. JavaScript is continuing to gain more and more adoption.
    </p>
    <p class="container-fluid">
        <b class="sub_heading">JavaScript is announced</b> <br>
        JavaScript was initially created by Brendan Eich of Netscape and was first announced in a press release by
        Netscape in 1995. It has a bizarre history of naming; initially it was named Mocha by the creator, which was
        later renamed to LiveScript. In 1996, about a year later after the release, NetScape decided to rename it to be
        JavaScript with hopes of capitalizing on the Java community (although JavaScript did not have any relationship
        with Java) and released Netscape 2.0 with the official support of JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p class="container-fluid">
        <b class="sub_heading">ES1, ES2 and ES3</b> <br>
        In 1996, Netscape decided to submit it to ECMA International with the hopes of getting it standardized. First
        edition of the standard specification was released in 1997 and the language was standardized. After the initial
        release, ECMAScript was continued to be worked upon and in no-time two more versions were released ECMAScript 2
        in 1998 and ECMAScript 3 in 1999.
    </p>
    <p class="container-fluid">
        <b class="sub_heading">Decade of Silence and ES4</b> <br>
        After the release of ES3 in 1999, there was a complete silence for a decade and no changes were made to the
        official standard. There was some work on the fourth edition in the initial days; some of the features that were
        being discussed included classes, modules, static typings, destructuring etc. It was being targeted to be
        released by 2008 but was abandoned due to political differences concerning language complexity. However, the
        vendors kept introducing the extensions to the language and the developers were left scratching their heads —
        adding polyfills to battle compatibility issues between different browsers.
    </p>
    <p class="container-fluid">
        <b class="sub_heading">From silence to ES5</b> <br>
        Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and other disputers of ES4 came together and decided to work on a less ambitious update
        to ES3 tentatively named ES3.1. But the teams were still fighting about what to include from ES4 and what not.
        Finally, in 2009 ES5 was released mainly focusing on fixing the compatibility and security issues etc. But there
        was not much of a splash in the water — it took ages for the vendors to incorporate the standards and many
        developers were still using ES3 without being aware of the “modern” standards.
    </p>
    <p class="container-fluid">
        <b class="sub_heading">Release of ES6 — ECMAScript 2015</b> <br>
        After a few years of the release of ES5, things started to change, TC39 (the committee under ECMA international
        responsible for ECMAScript standardization) kept working on the next version of ECMAScript (ES6) which was
        originally named ES Harmony, before being eventually released with the name ES2015. ES2015 adds significant
        features and syntactic sugar to allow writing complex applications. Some of the features that ES6 has to offer
        include
    <ol style="list-style-type: circle;">
        <li>Classes, Modules, Arrows</li>
        <li>Enhanced object literals</li>
        <li>Template strings</li>
        <li>Destructuring</li>
        <li>Default and rest parameters</li>
        <li>Spread operator</li>
        <li>let and const</li>
        <li>Proxies and Symbols</li>
        <li>Promises</li>
        <li>Math, Number, String, Array, Object APIs and etc</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p class="container-fluid">
        Browser support for ES6 is still scarce but everything that ES6 has to offer is still available to developers by
        transpiling the ES6 code to ES5. With the release of 6th version of ECMAScript, TC39 decided to move to yearly
        model of releasing updates to ECMAScript so to make sure that the new features are added as soon as they are
        approved and we don’t have to wait for the full specification to be drafted and approved — thus 6th version of
        ECMAScript was renamed as ECMAScript 2015 or ES2015 before the release in June 2015. And the next versions of
        ECMAScript were decided to published in June of every year.
